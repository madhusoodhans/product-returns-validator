"""Per-turn checks before the claim flow: the guardrail and the 9B / 27B choice.

Main path: one Router routing preview for `returns/auto` (recipe `returns` in deploy/router.yaml):
Vela 2.0 scores prompt attacks (blocks at 0.75) and PII (flag only) and picks qwen9b or qwen27b. The preview returns
the scores, which a chat response does not. When the Router blocks, d3-mini decides whether the message also holds a
real complaint: then the instruction is ignored and the complaint handled. If the preview fails, the d3-mini
fallbacks below take over.
